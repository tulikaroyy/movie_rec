# ðŸŽ¬ Content-Based Movie Recommendation System

A content-based movie recommendation system built using Python and Machine Learning techniques, with a simple frontend designed using Streamlit.

## About the Project

- Built a content-based filtering model that suggests the top 5 similar movies based on the user's selection.
- Used the TMDB Movie Dataset for movie metadata.
- Applied text vectorization (CountVectorizer) to understand movie similarities.
- Built the model and preprocessed the dataset in Jupyter Notebook.
- Designed and deployed a Streamlit web app for user interaction.

##  Dataset

- **Dataset:** TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset
- **Contains:** Movie metadata like title, genres, keywords, overview, etc.

##  How It Works

1. User selects a movie from the dropdown menu.
2. The system finds similar movies using content-based similarity scores (based on metadata like genre, overview, etc.).
3. Displays the top 5 recommended movies to the user.
